# prism_volume
Program that calculates the volume of a prism using given inputs from the user.

The program collects the user's inputs of the prism's length, height, base width, and top width. These inputs are stored and used to calculate the prism's volume. After a 25% reduction is made to the given inputs, further calculations are done to find the prism's volume. All displayed measurements and volumes are rounded to the nearest tenth place (.0) before being shown to the user. 

This code documents my progression in learning the Python coding language. It shows that I understand how to use basic arithmetic, computational skills, input storage of floats, and f strings. Please take a look at the notes in the code for further understanding of my step-by-step process.
